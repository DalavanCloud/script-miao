script-miao
==========

Open fonts and keyboards for the Miao (Pollard) script. These fonts and keyboards are still experimental and may change considerably in the future. The project is built using Smith (https://github.com/silnrsi/smith) based on the instructions in the "wscript" file.

For information on the ShiShan fonts see the documents in /fonts/shishan.
